# work_schedule

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a work schedule/todo list. This schedule would allow me to add todo items by the hour. If i refreshed the page the information written would be saved and still appear on the schedule. I built this project to get a better understanding of jQuery. 


## Installation

I added time-blocks to the html code. From there I made my variables in JavaScript. I set up my buttons and local storage. Used an if/else statement to create my past, present, and future color coded time-blocks. 

## Credits
 CSS and some HTML was provided by UCLA Bootcamp
